Level Goal
==========
The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory. 
Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.
=========

Run this command:

$ ssh bandit4@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -s 2220

Enter password:
pIwrPrtPN36QITSp3EQaw936yaFoFgAB

Now, go to inhere directory:

bandit4@bandit:~$ cd inhere/

A simple solution to find the only human-readable file would be as follows:

bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$ find . | xargs file | grep text
./-file07: ASCII text

Now read the file:

bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$ cat ./-file07
